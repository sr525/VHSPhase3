Dear Richard,

Please find below the content validation report for the VHS catalogue
submission (batch_1597). Some checks are still pending, so this report
is preliminary.

1) You should also submit the CHANGES.USER file
indicating which tiles update the previous versions
Here is an example on how to record the relationships between old and
new files in the CHANGES.USER file:
fs472446411477_v20100702_00272_469403.fits UPDATES
fs472446403411_v20100702_00272_469403.fits
fs472446411476_v20110528_00334_498134.fits UPDATES
fs472446404599_v20110528_00334_498134.fits
...

2) SKYSQDEG =1 for the meta catalogue, this value is fine for the tile
catalogues, but it should be the total area covered for the meta
catalogue.

3) Issue with FILTER keywords.
for the meta catalogue, I think
FILTER4 ='H' is missing

dfits ph3_mcatalog.fits | grep FILTER
FILTER1 = 'Y       '
FILTER2 = 'J       '
FILTER3 = 'Ks      '
FILTER  = 'MULTI   '

For the tile catalogues FILTER='MULTI' is missing:

dfits fs472446411477_v20100702_00272_469403.fits | grep FILTER
FILTER1 = 'Y       '
FILTER2 = 'J       '
FILTER3 = 'H       '
FILTER4 = 'Ks      '

4) OBJECT should not be present in the meta catalogue.
$ dfits ph3_mcatalog.fits | grep OBJECT
OBJECT  = 'DR4_472446404961'

In the tile catalogues OBJECT should not contain the 'DR4_' string

5) PROG_ID is always missing the run
dfits fs472446411477_v20100702_00272_469403.fits | grep PROG
PROG_ID = '179.A-2010'

but it should be
PROG_ID = '179.A-2010(A)'

or in case of more runs involved:
PROG_ID = 'MULTI'
PROGID1 = '179.A-2010(A)'
PROGID2 ='179.A-2010(B)'
...

6) MJD-OBS and MJD-END seem not to be precise.
For example for file
fs472446402561_v20150723_01039_1230021.fits
we have
MJD-OBS =        55182.0785057
MJD-END =        57227.3137996

and the provenance are
PROV1   = 'v20150723_01051_st_tl_cat.fits',
MJD-OBS = 57227.31380, MJD-END = 57227.31729

PROV2   = 'v20150723_01039_st_tl_cat.fits',
MJD-OBS=  57227.30965, MJD-END = 57227.31336

so for the catalogue tile, it should be
MJD-OBS = 57227.30965
MJD-END = 57227.31729

7) Regarding the TUCDi keywords,
they lack in precision and in describing the physical quantity they
refer to,
for example:
TUCD40= 'em.IR.NIR' -> 'phot.mag;em.IR.NIR'
TUCD41= 'stat.error' -> 'stat.error;em.IR.NIR'
TUCD18  = 'phot.color' -> 'phot.color;em.IR.J;em.IR.K'

In the previous version of the catalogue these are fine, you could have
a look at them.

8) You should consider to make use of the keywords TINDXi,
setting this flag TRUE signifies that this parameter is considered
important for searching and defining subsamples of data.
Based on this input a database index may be defined for this parameter
to make database queries efficient.

Kind regards,
Laura
